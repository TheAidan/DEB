# DEB

This is a simple neural network with code based on iamtrask's neural network tutorial as well as my own.

When combined with a currently unincluded natural language scale, it is intended to determine whether tweets are some form of sexual harassment. 

wih_cache.npy and who_cache.npy are the save files which contain the weights.

testval.txt contains the training set.

DEB1.0.py is the neural network along with it's I/O functions.
